Hello! I'm Max Derner,  
I work at BJSS and I'm currently helping to change the way the NHS does Cervical Cancer Screening. Cervical cancer is 100% preventable if everyone attends their screening appointments and we hope to eradicate cervical cancer in the UK.  

Anyway, I'm mostly working in Python and Bash, using AWS resources.  
Have a snoop, take a peruse, give a gander. If you want to chat about anything, I'll pretty much always make time for you.  

See you out in the wilds!
