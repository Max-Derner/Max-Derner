- 👋 Hi, I’m @Max-Derner
- 👀 I’m interested in all things maths based, abstract problem sovling, low-level tricks, microcontrollers, machine learning and data science...I'm just a curious student.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, Python and PostgreSQL.
- 💞️ I’m not really looking to collaborate but if you want to team up and get clever together them I'm all game!
- 📫 How to reach me: max.derner@gmail.com just use a really attention grabbing subject line that also doesn't look like spam.
