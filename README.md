- 👋 Hi, I’m @Max-Derner
- 👀 I’m interested in all things maths based, abstract problem sovling, low-level tricks, and good coding style...I'm mostly just a curious student, who also has a full time job as a Software Engineer.
- I still enjoy things like Leetcode and Codility. I make more home spun projects now.
- 🌱 I’m good friends with Python, work friends with Java, I chatted with C++ and PostgreSQL at the office party, where I was also introduced to C#, and I have been told to avoid JavaScript.
- 💞️ I’m not really looking to collaborate but if you want to team up and get clever together them I'm all game!
- 📫 How to reach me: max.derner@gmail.com just use a really attention grabbing subject line that also doesn't look like spam.
